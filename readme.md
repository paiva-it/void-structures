# C Void Structure Implementation

Small project where I want to gradually add several data structures in C using void\* to have a generic implementation of them.

All code is documented, but I will eventually add a ReadMe for each structure/library.

To build and run the project:
- `make` will build the project and output the `main` file
- `make clean` will cleanup any `.o` files
- `make run` will build and run the project
- `make run-tests` will build and run the project with the arg `run-tests` (will run testing library and output results to terminal)
